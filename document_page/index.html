            <p>According to the Java platform official website, the main difference between Java and JavaScript is that Java is an OOP programming language while JavaScript is an OOP programming script. JavaScript code is written completely in text and need only be interpreted. Java, on the other hand, must be compiled.</p>
            <p>They are also used for different types of projects. Java is used to make applications on devices or browsers, while JavaScript is used primarily on HTML documents and browsers. Different plug-ins are used in order to use Java and JavaScript.</p>
            <code>function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                return p1 * p2;
              },
              public class Main {
                static void myMethod() {
                  
                }
              }
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>Google uses Java in many of their applications, including their Web Toolkit, Android-based apps, and Gmail.</li>
                <li>JavaScript allows us to add dynamic behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly. They are usually the first programs that new coders learn, because even those with little or no experience can execute Hello World both easily and correctly.</p>
            <p>Above all, Hello World is simple. That’s why it is so often used as a barometer of program success. If Hello World does not work effectively within the framework, then it is likely that other, more complex programs will also fail. As one expert at Win-Vector opens in new windowputs it, Hello World is actually a confrontational program. “The author is saying ‘it isn’t obvious your computer system will work, so I am not going to invest a lot of time in it until I see it can at least print one line of text,’” Win-Vector blogger John Mount says.</p>
            <code>console.log("Hello World")</code>
            <ul>
                <li>It's a little sandbox that you know will work.</li>
                <li>If you can get a print hello world program up and running you have learned how to compile, link and run the program.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variable means anything that can vary. In JavaScript, a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It means it does not require a data type to be declared. You can assign any literal values to a variable, e.g., string, integer, float, boolean, etc.</p>
            <code>var x = 5;
                  var y = 6;
                  var z = x + y;
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
                <li>All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
            <header>Data Types</header>
            <p>Data types basically specify what kind of data can be stored and manipulated within a program.</p>
            <p>Primitive data types can hold only one value at a time, whereas composite data types can hold collections of values and more complex entities.</p>
            <code>let x = 16 + "Volvo";</code>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript evaluates expressions from left to right.</li>
                <li>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Variable_Scope" class="main-section">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>In JavaScript, a variable can also be used without declaring it. If a variable is used without declaring it, that variable automatically becomes a global variable.</p>
            <p>A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope variable.</p>
            <code>
                let x = 10;
                vs
                function A(){
                    let y = 10;
                }
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.</li>
                <li>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.</li>
